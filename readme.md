## Test Types
- Unit Testing: Test individual components and functions
- Integration Testing: Test component interactions
- End-to-End Testing: Test complete user workflows
- Regression Testing: Verify existing functionality still works
- Performance Testing: Test application speed and resource usage

## Testing Best Practices
1. Write clear, descriptive test names
2. Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
3. Keep tests independent and isolated
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Test edge cases and error handling
6. Maintain test coverage
